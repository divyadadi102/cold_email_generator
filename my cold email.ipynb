      "Subject: Application for Software Development Engineer at Amazon\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Hiring Manager,\n",
      "\n",
      "I am excited to apply for the Software Development Engineer position at Amazon, as advertised. With a Master's in Computer Science from Rice University and a strong background in Software Engineering and Data Analytics, I am confident that my skills align perfectly with the job requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although my portfolio did not yield a direct match with the job title, my experience and skills in software development, data transformation, and data analytics make me an ideal candidate for this role. My proficiency in programming languages, data modeling, and data management will enable me to create new products, features, and services from scratch, while managing ambiguity and pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Software Engineer at Affekta LLC, I developed and maintained data transformation pipelines, improving course import efficiency by 40% for an AI-driven adaptive learning platform. I also structured and validated JSON-based data models to enhance content accuracy. During my internship at American Unit Inc, I optimized SQL queries and designed efficient ETL pipelines to support the development of a Privacy Data Management System. Additionally, at Tata Consultancy Services, I designed and deployed interactive Power BI dashboards, improving reporting accuracy by 25% and enabling data-driven decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and managing complex systems, which aligns with Amazon's fast-paced and dynamic environment. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a talented team and contribute to the development of new products and services.\n",
